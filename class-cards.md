## What's it all about?
Class cards are like traditional music lessons, but better. Here's how:
- **More time.** Instead of stopping at 30 minutes when you're just getting warmed up, or doubling up to 60 minutes, all classes are Baby Bear-sized at 45-minutesâ€¦ just right!
- **More flexibility.** You don't have to worry about finding the one perfect time slot that is always going to work. Just grab a time slot that fits with your schedule on a per-lesson basis.
- **Less commitment.** Not sure how you're going to fit lessons around other after-school activities and holidays? No problem. Class cards never expire so you can focus on your priorities as they shift throughout the year.
- **Less hassle.** No more writing checks. No more texting back and forth to schedule make-ups. Everything is online and automated.

## How much do they cost?
Class cards start at $200 for 4 lessons, but there are discounts when you buy in bulk!
- 4 classes, $200
- 8 classes: $360 (10% discount)
- 12 classes: $510 (15% discount)

## Where do we meet?

Meetings will primarily take place online using Zoom for now. For students who are local to Woodbridge, Va., we may be able to do some in-person meetings, but we will talk first about COVID precautions.

## How do I buy class cards?
You can <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/sms-class-cards">buy class cards</a> online through my payment service, Gumroad. I'll be notified when you buy class cards and book lessons. They never expire so you can book your lessons whenever you want.

## How does scheduling work?
It's easy to <a href="https://calendly.com/sophiamusicstudio/45-minute-class/">schedule lessons</a> when you want using my calendar booking system. I'll make a range of time slots available, so you can just grab whatever works for you. It's all automatic!

## What about returns and exchanges?
Since class cards never expire, I canâ€™t accept returns, but if you decide at some point you donâ€™t want to use already purchased classes, you can transfer the unused classes to someone else.
