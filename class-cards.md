## What's it all about?
Class cards are like traditional music lessons, but better. Here's how:
- **More time.** Instead of stopping at 30 minutes when you're just getting warmed, or doubling up to 60 minutes, all classes are Baby Bear-sized at 45-minutesâ€¦ just right!
- **More flexibility.** You don't have to worry about finding the one perfect time slot that is always going to work. Just grab a time slot that fits with your schedule on a per-lesson basis.
- **Less commitment.** Not sure how you're going to fit lessons around other after-school activities and holidays? No problem. Class cards never expire so you can focus on your priorities as they shift throughout the year.
- **Less hassle.** No more writing checks. No more texting back and forth to schedule make-ups. Everything is online and automated.

## How does scheduling work?
It's easy to schedule lessons when you want using my calendar booking system. I'll make a range of time slots available, so you can just grab whatever works for you. It's all automatic!

## How much do they cost?
Class cards start at $200 for 4 lessons, but there are discounts when you buy in bulk!
- 4 lessons, $200

- 12 lessons: $xxx (XX% discount)

## How do I buy class cards?
You can buy class cards online through my payment service, Gumroad. I'll be notified when you buy class cards and book lessons. They never expire so you can book your lessons whenever you want.

## What about returns and exchanges?
Since they never expire, I can't accept returns, but if you decide at some point you don't want to use already purchased class cards, you can transfer them to someone else.
