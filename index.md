title: "Introducing: Passion Projects for Piano Online"
permalink: /
intro: "After taking a break, I've decided to try something new and different for Sophia Music Studio. Reflecting on my years of teaching, I've found the students who grow the most and have the most fun are the ones who have a clear idea of what they're working toward. So instead of ongoing, weekly lessons, where there's so much pressure for magic to happen in those 30-minute classes, I'm starting a new format: 3-month projects where we work together to achieve a specific goal for you.

## What's it all about?

Passion Projects are not your traditional piano lessons. These are designed to be creative musical projects that I will coach you on as you work toward a meaningful goal that we set for you together.

This approach requires a firm commitment and intense focus for a 3-month timeline during which we'll meet on a regular basis for both demonstration of your progress and short check-ins to answer questions and keep you on track. We'll also collaborate offline through chat and sharing other resources and materials to support you in your goal.

Instead of working through piano level books and preparing for recitals, we will be working together on an individualized curriculum designed for your specific project.

**Because of the time commitment this will require on my part, I am only accepting 10 students at a time into this program.** I will not be doing any other teaching outside of these Passion Projects.

### What are some examples of Passion Project goals?

These are just some examples. At the beginning of the project, I'll help you come up with a challenging goal that is meaningful to you.

- Record a 3-song demo on GarageBand.
- Play and sing all Taylor Swift's songs off her new album.
- Audition for a show, gig, or theatrical production.
- Write songs for a musical or arrange music for a film production.
- Accompany my community choir group.
- Play holiday music at family gatherings.

## Who is this a good fit for?

This approach to learning piano requires more self-motivation than your typical piano lessons.

A good-fit student is someone who sounds like the following:

- Loves to figure out how to play their favorite songs on piano.
- Learns by listening to music frequently and intently.
- Loves to show off when they've learned a song.
- Isn't afraid to try new things and be creative.
- Imagines themselves doing fun things with music.
- Somewhere between the ages of 10 and 100 years old.

My expertise is in playing and singing popular music on piano. I emphasize  playing by ear and building a foundation of rhythm, melody, and harmony using a chord-based approach. I can also teach you how to branch out into songwriting, arranging, or producing music to picture for those who are interested in exploring these arenas.

## What does a project include?

Each project will run for 3 months and includes the following:

- Weekly, 45-minute Zoom session
- Weekly, 15-minute check-in
- Personalized project goal
- Personalized at-home practice plan
- Intermittent offline communication as needed

Note: A project can start any time; there are no seasonal start/end dates. We can schedule the meeting times to occur regularly but the schedule can be fluid as needed.

## Who is Sophia?

Hello! My name is Sophia Levy. I'm a wife and mom-of-two living in Woodbridge, VA, about 30 miles south of Washington D.C.

After growing up in Jakarta, Indonesia, I graduated from Berklee College of Music in Boston where I studied piano, voice, songwriting, and music synthesis.

Iâ€™ve written and recorded lots of songs for cable and network television in the U.S. and Asia, and written songs for major label artists in Asia. I also released my own album in Indonesia and starred in a kids show in Singapore.

Over the past 10 years, I have taught piano and voice with over 200 students in Northern Virginia and engaged them in a wide variety of performance and recording experiences, including cafes, clubs, restaurants, senior homes, festivals, pop-rock band workshops, competitions, and fundraisers.

In addition to music, I love yoga, meditation, cooking, dancing, gardening, entrepreneurship, and overall health and wellness.

## What if I have more questions?

No problem! [Send me an email](mailto:sophia@sophiamusicstudio.com) with any other questions you have.
