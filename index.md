title: "Introducing: Passion Projects <em>for Piano</em>"
permalink: /
intro: "After taking a break, I've decided to try something new and different for Sophia Music Studio. Reflecting on my years of teaching, I've found the students who grow the most and have the most fun are the ones who have a clear idea of what they're working toward. So instead of ongoing, weekly lessons, where there's so much pressure for magic to happen in those 30-minute classes, I'm starting a new format: 3-month projects where we work together to achieve a specific goal for you.

## What's it all about?

Passion Projects are not your grandmother's piano lessons. These are designed to be creative musical projects that I will coach you on to meet a meaningful goal that we set for you together.

This approach requires a firm commitment and intense focus for a 3-month timeline during which we'll meet on a regular basis for both demonstration of your progress and short check-ins to answer questions and keep you on track. We'll also collaborate offline through chat and sharing other resources and materials to support you in your goal.

Instead of working through piano level books and preparing for recitals, we will be working together on an individualized curriculum designed for your specific project.

**Because of the time commitment this will require on my part, I am only accepting 10 students at a time into this program.** I will not be doing any other teaching outside of these Passion Projects.

### What are some examples of Passion Project goals?

- Recording a 3-song demo on GarageBand.
- Playing and singing all Taylor Swift's songs of her new album.
- Starting a band.
- Auditioning for a show, gig, or theatrical production.
- Writing music for a film or video production with your friends.

These are just some examples. At the beginning of the project, I'll help you come up with a challenging goal that is meaningful to you.

## Who is this a good fit for?

This approach to learning piano requires more self-motivation than your typical piano lessons.

A good-fit student is someone who fits the following description:

- Loves to figure out how to play their favorite songs on piano.
- Learns by listening to music frequently and intently.
- Loves to show off when they've learned a song.
- Isn't afraid to try new things and be creative.
- Imagines themselves doing fun things with music.

My expertise is in playing and singing popular music on piano. I emphasize  playing by ear and building a foundation of rhythm, melody & harmony using the chord-based system. I can also teach you how to branch out to songwriting, arranging or producing music to picture for those who are interested to explore in these arenas.

## What does a project include?

- Each project will run for 3 months.
- Weekly, 45-minute Zoom session
- Weekly, 15-minute check-in
- Personalized project goal
- Personalized at-home practice plan
- Intermittent offline communication as needed

Note: A project can start anytime; there are no seasonal start/end dates. We can schedule the meeting times to occur regularly but the schedule can be fluid as needed.
