Hello! My name is Sophia Levy. I'm a wife and mom-of-two living in Woodbridge, VA, about 30 miles south of Washington D.C.

After growing up in Jakarta, Indonesia, I graduated from Berklee College of Music in Boston where I studied piano, voice, songwriting, and music synthesis.

I’ve written and recorded dozens of songs for cable and network television in the U.S. and Asia, and written songs for major label artists in Asia. I also released my own album in Indonesia and starred in a kids show in Singapore.

After establishing Sophia Music Studio in 2011, I have taught piano and voice with over 200 students in Northern Virginia and engaged them in a wide variety of performance and recording experiences, including cafes, clubs, restaurants, senior homes, festivals, pop-rock band workshops, competitions, and fundraisers.

In addition to music, I love yoga, meditation, cooking, dancing, gardening, entrepreneurship, and overall health and wellness.
