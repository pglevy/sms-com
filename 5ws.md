# Progression Projects
After taking a break, I've decided to try something new and different for Sophia Music Studio. Reflecting on my years of teaching, I've found the students who grow the most and have the most fun are the ones who have a clear idea of what they're working toward.

So instead of ongoing, weekly lessons, where there's so much pressure for magic to happen in those 30-minute classes, I'm starting a new format: 3-month projects where we work together to achieve a specific goal for you. Read onâ€¦

## How will this work?

 - We're not focusing on completing a book. We're completing a goal that has meaning to you.
 - We're not doing a 30-minute lesson a week format, but rather a 3-month intensive package project with a weekly 45-minute online meeting with me and offline ongoing conversations, focused assignments and check-ins throughout the week.
