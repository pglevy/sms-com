# Progression Projects
After taking a break, I've decided to try something new and different for Sophia Music Studio. Reflecting on my years of teaching, I've found the students who grow the most and have the most fun are the ones who have a clear idea of what they're working toward.

So instead of ongoing, weekly lessons, where there's so much pressure for magic to happen in those 30-minute classes, I'm starting a new format: 3-month projects where we work together to achieve a specific goal for you. Read onâ€¦

## How will this work?

 - We're not focusing on completing a book. We're completing a goal that has meaning to you.
 - We're not doing a 30-minute lesson a week format, but rather a 3-month intensive package project for your goal, a weekly 45-minute online meeting and offline ongoing conversations, focused assignments and check-ins throughout the week. 
 - I'm not interested in teaching an individual who is not driven by their own interest, because I know I will put my 100% time and energy to those who is eager and excited to learn to achieve their goals. It must be a 2-way communication to work. 
 - I'm only taking 10 students at one time to provide quality time and energy to focus on each individual.
 - You are not going to go through the same method as others, because I will give you an individualized curriculum designed to your specific goal, derived from different sources of books, my own notes/exercises/drills
