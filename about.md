Hello! My name is Sophia Levy. My students call me Ms. Sophia.

I graduated from Berklee College of Music in Boston where I studied piano, voice, songwriting, and music synthesis.

Iâ€™ve written and recorded lots of songs for cable and network television in the U.S., and written songs for major label artists in Asia. I also released my own album in Indonesia and starred in a kids show in Singapore.

I love working with kids to help them find their voice and have fun making cool music.


## What I believe

- I am a creative piano/voice project coach.
- I love helping musicians to play popular songs by ear, using chord based method, which can lead to writing their own original songs, and be an independent musician who can play any popular songs they hear.
- I believe doing projects will bring your music goal to life.
- I also believe learning to play the piano doesn't need to be stressful. It's supposed to be fun.
- I can help make your musical goal happen for you.
- No competition, no judgement, pure joy of learning and continuous improvement, and oh, always celebrate the little wins!
